# Usage

In order to download the newest available hash lists from virusshare.com, you can run the download_hashes.py script.

*** ./download_hashes.py /path/to/your/download/directory ***

It takes a lot of time to download. The files are names 000.md5 - xxx.md5 and already available files are skipped.
